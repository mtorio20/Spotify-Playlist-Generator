# Spotify-Playlist-Generator
In order to use the main program, you must have 3 items entered into the secretsspotify file: <br />
-A spotify account user id must be entered in for spotify_user_id(), <br />
-An authorization must be obtained from Spotify's developer console (https://developer.spotify.com/console/post-playlist-tracks/) Keep in mind OAuth Tokens from spotify expire every 30minutes-1 hour. If playlists are not generating songs correctly, make sure playlist-modify-public or playlist-modify-private are enabled when obtaining a token <br />
-Lastly, a lastFM api key must be generated https://www.last.fm/api
